# Booking Flow Analysis - Search to Payment & Notification

## Complete Flow Overview

### 1. Search Flow
- **Entry Point**: `/find/[...slug]/page.jsx` - Dynamic search page
- **Search Process**: 
  - User selects specialization, location, date
  - System searches for available therapists
  - Shows available time slots
  - User selects therapist and time slot

### 2. Booking Creation Flow
- **Component**: `TherapistCard.jsx` handles booking initiation
- **Process**:
  1. User clicks "Book Now"
  2. System validates user login
  3. Shows 20% platform fee confirmation
  4. Calls `createBookingAndPayment()` from `stripe.js`
  5. Creates booking in database with "pending" status
  6. Creates Stripe checkout session
  7. Redirects to Stripe payment page

### 3. Payment Flow
- **Stripe Integration**: 
  - Creates checkout session with booking metadata
  - Success URL: `/payment-success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}&booking_id={bookingReference}`
  - Cancel URL: `/payment-cancel`
  - Stores payment record with "pending" status

### 4. Payment Success Flow
- **Webhook Handler**: `/api/stripe-webhook/route.js`
- **Process**:
  1. Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` event
  2. System updates payment status to "completed"
  3. Updates booking status to "confirmed"
  4. Sends email notifications to all parties
  5. Creates database notifications

### 5. Email Notification System
