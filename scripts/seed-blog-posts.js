          <h2>Understanding Lower Back Pain</h2>
          <p>Lower back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal problems affecting people worldwide. Whether it's due to poor posture, sedentary lifestyle, or injury, the impact on daily life can be significant.</p>
          
          <h3>Exercise 1: Pelvic Tilts</h3>
          <p>Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Gently tilt your pelvis to flatten your lower back against the floor, then release. Repeat 10-15 times.</p>
          
          <h3>Exercise 2: Cat-Cow Stretch</h3>
          <p>Start on your hands and knees. Arch your back like a cat, then drop your belly and lift your head like a cow. Repeat 10 times.</p>
          
          <h3>Exercise 3: Bird Dog</h3>
          <p>On hands and knees, extend your right arm and left leg simultaneously. Hold for 5 seconds, then switch sides. Repeat 10 times each side.</p>
          
          <h3>Exercise 4: Bridge Exercise</h3>
          <p>Lie on your back with knees bent. Lift your hips off the ground, creating a straight line from shoulders to knees. Hold for 5 seconds, then lower.</p>
          
          <h3>Exercise 5: Knee-to-Chest Stretch</h3>
          <p>Lie on your back and gently pull one knee toward your chest. Hold for 30 seconds, then switch legs.</p>
          
          <h2>When to Seek Professional Help</h2>
          <p>If your back pain persists for more than a few weeks, is severe, or is accompanied by other symptoms like numbness or weakness, consult a physiotherapist for a proper assessment and treatment plan.</p>

          <h3>Phase 2: Early Recovery (Weeks 2-6)</h3>
          <p>Gradual increase in activity level, strengthening exercises, and improving range of motion. This phase is crucial for rebuilding strength and function.</p>
          
          <h3>Phase 3: Advanced Recovery (Weeks 7-12)</h3>
          <p>More intensive exercises, functional training, and preparation for return to normal activities or sports.</p>
          
          <h2>Key Recovery Principles</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Follow your physiotherapist's guidance</li>

        content: `
          <h2>Prevention is Better Than Cure</h2>
          <p>Sports injuries can be devastating for athletes, affecting performance and potentially ending careers. However, many injuries are preventable with proper preparation and care.</p>
          
          <h3>Warm-Up and Cool-Down</h3>
          <p>Never skip your warm-up routine. A proper warm-up increases blood flow, improves flexibility, and prepares your muscles for activity. Similarly, cool-down exercises help prevent muscle stiffness and promote recovery.</p>
          
          <h3>Proper Technique</h3>
          <p>Learning and maintaining proper technique is crucial for injury prevention. Poor form can lead to overuse injuries and acute trauma. Consider working with a coach or physiotherapist to perfect your technique.</p>
          
          <h3>Gradual Progression</h3>
          <p>Avoid the "too much, too soon" trap. Gradually increase the intensity, duration, and frequency of your training to allow your body to adapt.</p>
          
          <h3>Cross-Training</h3>
          <p>Incorporate different types of exercise into your routine to prevent overuse injuries and maintain overall fitness.</p>
          
          <h3>Recovery and Rest</h3>
          <p>Rest days are essential for muscle repair and growth. Listen to your body and take breaks when needed.</p>
          
          <h2>Common Sports Injuries and Prevention</h2>
          <p>Understanding common injuries in your sport can help you take preventive measures. Consult with a sports physiotherapist for sport-specific advice.</p>

          <h3>Education and Self-Management</h3>
          <p>Learning about your condition and how to manage it empowers you to take control of your pain and recovery.</p>
